## Development

### Common guidelines

Please refer to the main [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) file in this repository for general guidelines about contributing to this project. Once you have read and understood them, you can follow the specific guidelines for this component.

### Installation

This repository use Pnpm as dependencies manager. So, to start working on them, you have to install the dependencies by running `pnpm install` in the root folder of the repository.

Please refer to the monorepo README file for further information about [common requirements](../../README.md#requirements) and [installation process](../../README.md#installation).

### Monorepo tool

The repository uses [Nx](https://nx.dev/) as monorepo tool for managing dependencies between component tasks, so, you should run any command for this component from the repository root folder, and Nx will take care of executing the dependent commands in the right order.

For example, a command that could be executed like this in this folder:

```sh title="Execute unit tests of the component inside its folder"
pnpm run test:unit
```

> ![WARNING] No management of task dependencies
> The previous command will only execute the unit tests of the component, which may fail if the component has dependencies that are not built yet, for example.

Should be executed like this in any folder of the repository:

```sh title="Execute unit tests of the component, and all needed dependencies, from any folder"
pnpm nx test:unit markdown-confluence-sync
```

> ![TIP] Management of task dependencies
> The previous command will execute the unit tests of the component and all the dependencies needed to run them, and will take advantage of the cache to avoid unnecessary executions.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/). To run them, execute the following command:

```sh
pnpm nx test:unit markdown-confluence-sync
```

### Component tests

Component tests are executed using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) also, but they use a child process to start the component's CLI and verify that it calls to the Confluence API as expected. The Confluence API is mocked using a mock server, so the component doesn't need to connect to a real Confluence instance.

There are different docs fixtures in the `test/component/fixtures` directory that are used to test different scenarios.

To run them, execute the following command, which will start the mock server and execute the tests:

```sh
pnpm nx test:component markdown-confluence-sync
```

You can also start the mock server in a separate terminal, and then execute the tests, which will allow you to see and change the requests and responses in the mock server in real time, so you can better understand what is happening, and debug the tests:

```sh
pnpm nx confluence:mock markdown-confluence-sync
```

And, in a separate terminal:

```sh
pnpm nx test:component:run markdown-confluence-sync
```

### Build

This command generates the library into the `dist` directory. __Note that other components in the repository won't be able to use the library until this command is executed.__

```sh
pnpm nx build markdown-confluence-sync
```
